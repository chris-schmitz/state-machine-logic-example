# State Machine Logic Example

At the moment I'm pretty new to the idea of building my own state/scheduling logic. I _get_ it, but it's not exactly second nature yet.

I was reading through the [adafruit explanation of state machines for arduino](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-1/using-millis-for-timing) and wrote out their "FlashWithoutDelay" example. The logic in the example wasn't immediately obvious to me so I sat down, read it through, and made sure I understood exactly what was happening.

Once I got it I decided to rename some of the variables so they were (in my opinion) a bit more clear as far as intension and then I wrote out really verbose comments in code.

I'm posting this for myself, but hopefully it can be helpful for anyone starting to grok state machines for arduino.
